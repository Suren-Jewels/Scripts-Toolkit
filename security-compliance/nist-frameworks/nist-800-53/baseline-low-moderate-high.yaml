baselines:
  LOW:
    description: "Minimal control set for low-impact systems (synthetic)."
    controls:
      - "AC-1"
      - "AC-2"
      - "AU-2"
      - "CM-2"
      - "CP-9"
      - "IA-2"

  MODERATE:
    description: "Control set for moderate-impact systems (synthetic)."
    controls:
      - "AC-1"
      - "AC-2"
      - "AC-3"
      - "AU-2"
      - "AU-6"
      - "CM-2"
      - "CP-9"
      - "IA-2"
      - "SC-7"
      - "SI-2"

  HIGH:
    description: "Enhanced control set for high-impact systems (synthetic)."
    controls:
      - "AC-1"
      - "AC-2"
      - "AC-3"
      - "AU-2"
      - "AU-6"
      - "CM-2"
      - "CP-9"
      - "IA-2"
      - "SC-7"
      - "SI-2"
      # In real environments, HIGH would include additional enhanced controls.

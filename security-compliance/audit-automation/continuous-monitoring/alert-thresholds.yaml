# Centralized thresholds and policies for continuous monitoring components:

# - anomaly-detector.py
# - other alerting/monitoring tools

# No credentials or secrets must ever be stored here.
# This file is safe to version-control in standard repositories.

# Severity thresholds define alerting limits for different event severities.
severity_thresholds:
  # Example: maximum number of events per minute allowed per severity.
  # These values are consumed by real-time-compliance-monitor.py for
  # determining whether an event stream should be considered saturated.
  low:
    max_per_minute: 500
  medium:
    max_per_minute: 200
  high:
    max_per_minute: 50
  critical:
    max_per_minute: 10

# Global anomaly detection configuration shared across systems.
anomaly_detection:
  # Sliding window size used by anomaly-detector.py.
  window_size: 20

  # Absolute z-score threshold for anomaly flagging.
  # A value of 3.0 is a common default for significant anomalies.
  zscore_threshold: 3.0

  # Optional per-metric overrides.
  # For example, this can be used when certain metrics are naturally spiky.
  metrics:
    # Example metric override:
    # login_failures:
    #   window_size: 50
    #   zscore_threshold: 4.0

# Optional rule-based alert escalation policies.
# These can be referenced by monitoring components to decide what to do
# when thresholds are exceeded (e.g., send email, open ticket, page on-call).
alert_policies:
  # Policy identifiers should be stable and human-meaningful.

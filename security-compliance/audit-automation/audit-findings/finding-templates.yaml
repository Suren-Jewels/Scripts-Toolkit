# finding-templates.yaml
# Standard templates for audit findings and remediation planning.
#
# These templates are consumed by remediation-plan-generator.py and can also be
# used as reference patterns during audit execution to keep findings consistent.
#
# Notes:
# - You can add, remove, or modify templates without changing the code.
# - Fields under "match" are used for template selection. Any of them can be
#   omitted to make the template more generic.

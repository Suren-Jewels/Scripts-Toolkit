# 🧰 Scripts Toolkit  
**Automation • SRE Utilities • Diagnostics • Networking • Identity • Cloud**

## 📌 Overview

The **Scripts Toolkit** is a curated, production-ready collection of automation utilities and troubleshooting frameworks used across Cloud, SRE, Security, and Infrastructure environments.

This toolkit reflects real-world engineering patterns designed to improve reliability, accelerate diagnostics, and standardize operational workflows across Linux, Windows, and hybrid systems.

The structure below represents a **clean, senior-level SRE layout**, organized by engineering function rather than programming language.
